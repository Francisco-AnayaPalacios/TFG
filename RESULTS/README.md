# üìä Experimental Results & Analysis  

This section compiles the **main experimental results, graphs, and conclusions** obtained during the project *Construcci√≥n de mapas de exteriores con un LiDAR 3D embarcado en un robot m√≥vil*.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Mapping Experiments  

Two mapping sessions were carried out at the **ETSII Faculty, University of M√°laga**:  

- **Mapping 1 ‚Äì Outdoor courtyard**  
  - Distance traveled: **90.80 m**  
  - Generated a dense point cloud of the exterior patio.  

- **Mapping 2 ‚Äì Entire building**  
  - Distance traveled: **959.18 m**  
  - Complete 3D reconstruction of the faculty‚Äôs building.  

Both datasets were later **post-processed** (combination, filtering, voxelization, and georeferencing).

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Processing Results  

- **Combination:** merged partial maps into large-scale environments.  
- **Filtering:** removed outliers and enabled sectional visualizations at specific heights.  
- **Voxelization:** reduced dataset size while preserving geometric detail.  
- **Georeferencing:** aligned point clouds with **EPSG:4326 ‚Üí EPSG:25830**, enabling integration with **ArcGIS**.  

üìå Example: Mapa 2 compared against official 3D building models, showing high spatial consistency.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Localization Experiments  

The generated maps were validated in **localization tasks** using **Iterative Closest Point (ICP)**.  

### ICP with 10 iterations
- Produced a stable but less accurate registration.  
- Comparison between **Ground Truth (Fast-LIO2)**, **Noisy Odometry**, and **ICP Estimated pose** showed partial correction of errors.

</p>

### ICP with 1000 iterations
- Significantly improved trajectory alignment.  
- RMSE error decreased as iteration count increased.

### Effect of voxelization size
- Smaller voxel sizes ‚Üí higher accuracy but longer computation time.  
- Larger voxel sizes ‚Üí reduced computation time but loss of detail.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusions  

- ‚úÖ Achieved construction of **dense, georeferenced 3D point-cloud maps**.  
- ‚úÖ Demonstrated applicability for **localization** using ICP.  
- ‚úÖ Validated accuracy and robustness compared to GPS, especially in altitude-sensitive navigation.  

### üîÆ Future Work  
- Real-time (online) map generation.  
- Integration of additional data (color, texture).  
- Deployment in **autonomous navigation pipelines**.
