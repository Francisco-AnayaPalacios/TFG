**Official title in Spanish:**  
*Construcci√≥n de mapas de exteriores con un LiDAR 3D embarcado en un robot m√≥vil*

## üìñ Overview
This project consists of the development of a **LiDAR-based mapping and localization pipeline** implemented as my **Final Degree Project (Bachelor‚Äôs Thesis)** at the *University of M√°laga (ETSII)*.  

The system focuses on generating **dense 3D point-cloud maps** of outdoor environments using a robot-mounted LiDAR sensor. The mapping process integrates algorithms such as **Iterative Closest Point (ICP)** for scan matching and alignment, and leverages advanced SLAM approaches like **Fast-LIO2** (LiDAR-Inertial Odometry) within **ROS 2** and **PCL**.  

The generated maps are **georeferenced**, which allows them to be exploited in **outdoor, semi-outdoor, and indoor environments**, even in **GPS-denied scenarios**.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Languages:** Python, C++, C  
- **Frameworks & Middleware:** ROS 2 (Robot Operating System), PCL (Point Cloud Library)  
- **Algorithms & SLAM Approaches:** Iterative Closest Point (ICP), Fast-LIO2 (LiDAR-Inertial Odometry)  
- **Hardware:** 3D LiDAR sensor mounted on a mobile robot  
- **Visualization & Simulation:** RViz, Gazebo  
- **Data Processing:** NumPy, Open3D, Matplotlib  

---

## üõë Problem Addressed
Traditional **GPS-based localization** presents significant limitations:  
- **Urban canyons** (multipath, poor satellite visibility).  
- **Indoor and semi-indoor areas** (garages, tunnels).  
- **Altitude navigation**, where GPS accuracy strongly decreases in the vertical axis.  

This implementation provides a **LiDAR-based alternative**, offering consistent **absolute localization** with the **same precision in all axes**, making it especially useful in high-altitude navigation scenarios.  

---

## ‚úÖ Results
- High-resolution **3D point-cloud maps** with detailed geometric information.  
- Robust scan registration using **ICP** algorithms.  
- Efficient localization with **low computational overhead**.  
- Same precision maintained across all axes (X, Y, Z), unlike GPS, which has **lower accuracy in altitude**.  
- Demonstrated applicability to **autonomous navigation** tasks in complex environments.

## üîÆ Possible Future Implementations
The methodology is not limited to a single robot:  
- **Multi-robot fleets:** once an environment has been mapped, the **3D model can be reused**, allowing other robots to localize without remapping.  
- **Autonomous vehicles:** robust backup system in **GPS-denied zones**, especially relevant for drones or ground robots operating in altitude-sensitive tasks.  
- **High-altitude navigation:** precise localization in vertical structures (e.g., tall buildings, towers, industrial plants) where GPS becomes unreliable.  
- **Rescue robotics & industrial inspection:** reliable navigation in collapsed structures, underground tunnels, or multi-level environments.  
- **Smart infrastructure:** integration with digital twins and urban planning systems.
