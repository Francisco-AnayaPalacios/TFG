## RESULTS

During this thesis we generated dense 3D point-cloud maps with high geometric detail, which were successfully analyzed in localization applications. This enables an accurate localization pipeline with low computational load.

Because the maps are georeferenced, they can be used for localization both outdoors and in semi-outdoor/indoor environments, providing absolute localization where GPS may be unavailable.

This is particularly relevant for precise autonomous navigation in such environments for platforms like autonomous cars and UGVs.
